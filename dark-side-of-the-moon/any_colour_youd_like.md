# Any Colour You'd Like

Draw poker where hands are made exclusively of one color (red or black).

## Gameplay

For two to eight players (if more than four players are playing, you must use two decks). Players must build their hands from exclusively one color from their 9-card hand.

* Deal 9 cards face down to each player, followed by a betting round.
* Each player in rotation decides how many cards they'd like to replace (0, 1, 2, 3, or 4); they discard those cards and the dealer replaces them from the deck. After all draws are completed, there's another betting round.
* All players reveal one card of the color that they will be using to make their hands, followed by a final betting round. Showdown. Best mono-colored hand wins.

## Variations

1. Worst hand wins.
2. After the draw phase, players reveal the 4 cards they are NOT using to build their hands.
