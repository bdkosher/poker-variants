# Breathe

Hold 'em with folding players contributing cards to the community cards.

## Gameplay

The community cards in this game are referred to as "The Lung." Whenever a player folds, he puts 1 card from his hand into "The Lung" and removes 1 different card.

* Deal 2 community cards face up and 2 hole cards face down to each player, followed by a round of betting.
* Deal 1 community card face up, followed by a round of betting.
* Deal 1 community card face up, followed by a round of betting.
* Deal 1 community card face up, followed by a final round of betting. Showdown. Best hand wins.

## Variations
1. After the initial deal, deal 1 hole card face down to each player instead of 1 community card.
2. Folding players only add cards to The Lung: no removals.
