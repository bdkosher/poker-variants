# Us and Them

Texas Hold 'em but with two sets of community cards.

## Gameplay

Play is like Texas Hold 'em except that there are two sets of community cards played, dubbed "Us" and "Them". Place a chip by the "Us" set to help distinguish between the two. If players' hole cards are the same color, they'll use the "Us" community cards; otherwise they use the "Them" cards.

* Deal two cards face down to each player, followed by a betting round.
* Deal the "Us" flop (3 cards face up) and the "Them" flop (3 cards face up), followed by a betting round.
* Deal the "Us" turn (1 card face up) and the "Them" turn (1 card face up), followed by a betting round.
* Deal the "Us" river (1 card face up) and the "Them" river (1 card face up), followed by a betting round. Showdown. Best hand wins made from the hole cards and the appropriate "Us" or "Them" community card set. Players cannot use cards from both community card sets.

## Variations
* Two red hole cards = "Us", Two black hole cards = "Them", a red and black means players can choose to use either "Us" or "Them" to make their hands.
* Best "Us" hand and best "Them" hand split the pot.
