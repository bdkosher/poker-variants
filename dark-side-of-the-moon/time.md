# Time

Stud poker where players can exchange cards when they raise.

## Gameplay

* Deal 5 cards face up in the middle of the table. These are non-community cards called "The Clock".
* Play proceeds as typical 7-card stud: there's an initial deal of 2 cards face down and 1 card face up to each player. After a betting round, 1 card is dealt face up to each player. This repeats until a final 7th card is dealt face down to each player, followed by a final betting round and showdown.
* Whenever a player raises, they may exchange one of their face up cards with one of the face up cards in "The Clock."

## Variations
1. Instead of exchanging a card with "The Clock", players discard one of their face up cards and take a card from "The Clock"
2. Instead of exchanging a card with "The Clock", players discard one of their face up cards and take a card from "The Clock" and the dealer deals a new card into the clock so there's always 5 cards in it.
3. 5-card stud instead of 7-card stud.
