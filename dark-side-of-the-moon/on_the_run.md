# On the Run

Seven card stud with a twist.

## Gameplay

* Deal 4 cards face up in the middle of the table. These are pseudo-community cards called "The Run".
* Play proceeds as typical 7-card stud: there's an initial deal of 2 cards face down and 1 card face up to each player. After a betting round, 1 card is dealt face up to each player. This repeats until a final 7th card is dealt face down to each player, followed by a final betting round and showdown.
* The catch is that if a player has a Three among their face down cards, then they use the cards in "The Run" plus their face down hole cards to make their hand. Otherwise, they use the cards dealt to them to make up their hand.

## Variations
1. Players can pay a fixed amount (determined before the start of the game) to have their 7th card dealt face up (to avoid the risk of being dealt a Three as their final card).
2. Being dealt a Three and/or Seven face down requires use of "The Run" to make one's hand.
